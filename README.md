# Student-budget-chart-using-python
This program is designed to assist students in managing their monthly budget. It prompts the user to input their monthly expense target, followed by detailed expenses for rent, utilities, transportation, and food. A constant car payment expense of $325.75 is also factored in. The output is a structured chart displaying each expense category, its amount, and its percentage of the total expenses.

Below the chart, the program will display the initial budget goal, the sum of all expenses, and the remaining balance. The output will be formatted to two decimal places and aligned neatly using field widths. The chart will be personalized with your name in the title and organized with blank lines for clarity.

For accuracy, you should run the program with various data sets. For your final submission, use the provided data set, capture a screenshot of the output, and submit it along with your source code in a .py file.
